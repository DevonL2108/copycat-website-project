## Reflection  
I did the project to test my HTML and CSS skills and to learn more about HTML and CSS. I chose to do the DeltaMath website because it was right in the middle, not too challenging and not too easy. Throughout the process I gained time management, how to Google, and organization skills. I gained time management and organization skills by setting up a planner on what to do on the specific days. During Monday, I started with naming the HTML and CSS elements and properties I needed to create the DeltaMath website. I also started coding a bit of the HTML. During Tuesday, I tried to create the bar and logo at the top of the website. On Wednesday, I added the image, the image border, and started on the sign-in box. Then on Thursday, I finished my MVP for the project and worked on the reflection. I learned how to Google through the process of all this. When I was stuck on a code or didn't know how to make it the way I wanted, I Googled ways to try to resolve the issue. For example, I had to Google ways to use the hover property of CSS and learning how to add the graduation cap DeltaMath used. As a result, I had a lot of fun trying to copy the DeltaMath website and learned more about HTML and CSS.
